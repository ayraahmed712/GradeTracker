    <h1>About Moolah!</h1>
    <p> Moolah is the tool you turn to when you suddenly realize... "oh no!! I forgot to pay them back! I completely forgot how much i owed them. I shouldve kept track of how we split the bill when it happened!"
        <br>
        Well now, with Moolah, you will never have to worry about forgetting again! You can easily log your expenses, track who owes you money, and settle up with friends in the blink of an eye. No more awkward conversations or forgotten debts!
