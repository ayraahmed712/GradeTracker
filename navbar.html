  Okay so what i was trying to do here was have the navbar seperatly so it isnt cluttered in all of the pages because then i would 
  have to have bot hthe long html code and the javascript code in every single page 
  
  <div class="navbar">
  <div class="nav-links">
  <div class="dropdown">
    <a href="index.html" class="active">Home</a>
    <div class="dropdown-content">
      <a href="about.html">About Us</a>
      <a href="contact us.html">Contact Us</a>
    </div>
  </div>

  <a href="Money Owed.html">Track Splitter</a>

  This shows when you are logged in 
  <div class="dropdown" id="user-dropdown" style="display: none;">
    <span id="nav-user" class="dropbtn" style="color: black; cursor: pointer;"></span>
    <div class="dropdown-content">
      <button id="logout-button">Logout</button>
    </div>
  </div>

  This shows when you are logged out 
  <a href="account.html" id="login-link" style="color: black;">Login</a>
</div>
</div>  -->
